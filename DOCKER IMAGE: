Below is my github repo "https://github.com/buzzCraft/ACIT4040-AI-Project/tree/pratima_seamless"
I am doing these 4 steps on my local machine to implement the seamleassm4T model and code of seamleassm4T text to speech:
1. Cloning the github repository of seamleassm4T "https://github.com/facebookresearch/seamless_communication.git".
2. Using VS code terminal i fired this "cd seamless_communication-main"
3. The i fired this : "pip install ."
4. After that i was able to use the modules by firing the command in CLI "m4t_predict "Welcome to OsloMet?" t2st eng --src_lang eng --output_path english_translated_audio.wav"


Now the requirement is my teammates want to use this set up and get it working using a Docker image. Can you please give me a step-by-step process to create a docker image for achieving this functionality.
